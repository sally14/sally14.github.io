## Current work
I am Salomé Do, a PhD student working at LATTICE (Ecole Normale Supérieure) and médialab (Sciences Po). I'm working on natural language processing and its applications to social sciences. Before that, I was a student at ENSAE, interested in machine and deep learning. 

My work aims at developing innovative methods for modelling and mapping public issues based on their textual traces. Its ambition is twofold: on the one hand, to make it possible to compare the semantic spaces that result from different social spaces, and on the other hand, to finely model the argumentation and enunciation of actors in textual content from the web. The dissertation thus aims at describing the structure of the discursive dynamics of actors in different discussion arenas from the most public media space (press) to the conversational spaces hosted by social networks (Twitter, Facebook). 

Some of my current projects include:

- A project on the transformation of politics framing in french written press since 1950.
- A project on Bruno Latour's questionnaire on world-to-come after Covid-19
- A project on denial, delation schemes and controversies during Covid-19 crisis in France

 
## Teaching

 
 Apart from that, I :
 - Worked as a teaching assistant for Xavier Dupré's [Python for data scientist course at ENSAE](http://www.xavierdupre.fr/app/ensae_teaching_cs/helpsphinx/td_2a.html). I wrote some introductory material for my students, that you can find on my [teaching page](./teaching/teachings.md)
 - Teached a course named  **"Learning text representation for Social Sciences"** at Université Gustave Eiffel. A short syllabus can be found [here](/data/teaching_stuff/syllabus.pdf)
 - Worked as a teaching assistant for the [ML for NLP](https://nlp-ensae.github.io/) course at ENSAE.

 

 
## Previous work


On previous projects, I created biomedical named entity recognition systems for a startup called Posos which led to [this](https://github.com/sally14/NLPBasics/blob/master/Report/report.pdf) brief synthesis about deep learning and NLP basics, and wrote a [langage model script with Tensorflow](https://github.com/sally14/language-model-ENSAE) for a NLP course at ENSAE.
