## Current work
I am Salomé Do, a PhD student working at LATTICE (Ecole Normale Supérieure) and médialab (Sciences Po). I'm working on natural language processing and its applications to social sciences. Before that, I was a student at ENSAE, interested in machine and deep learning. 

My work aims at using modern NLP methods on large media corpora in order to provide quantitative insights on traditional questions in Media and Political Sociology.



Some of my current projects include :

- A project on the transformation of politics framing in french written press since 1950.

- A project on retrieving sourced reported statements in media corpora
  

Some of my past projects include:

- [A project on Bruno Latour's questionnaire on world-to-come after Covid-19 ](https://sally14.github.io/data/Where_to_land_after_the_epidemic_V2.pdf)
- [A project on denial, delation schemes and controversies during Covid-19 crisis in France](https://doi.org/10.3917/scpo.lazar.2020.01.0223) (Published in Le monde d'aujourd'hui. Les sciences sociales au temps de la Covid., Presses de Sciences Po)
- A contribution to the project " Mapping AI issues in media through NLP methods" (accepted at CHR2021)


## Teaching


 Apart from that, I :
 - Worked as a teaching assistant for Xavier Dupré's [Python for data scientist course at ENSAE](http://www.xavierdupre.fr/app/ensae_teaching_cs/helpsphinx/td_2a.html) for 2 years. I wrote some introductory material for my students, that you can find on my [teaching page](./teaching/teachings.md)
 - Taught a course named  **"Learning text representation for Social Sciences"** at Université Gustave Eiffel. A short syllabus can be found [here](/data/teaching_stuff/syllabus.pdf)
 - Worked as a teaching assistant for the [ML for NLP](https://nlp-ensae.github.io/) course at ENSAE.
 - Taught an introductory course [Learning Text Representations for Social Sciences](/data/teaching_stuff/NLP_Course_X.pdf) for Etienne Ollion at Ecole Polytechnique

 


## Previous work


On previous projects during my master's degree, I created biomedical named entity recognition systems for a startup called Posos which led to [this](https://github.com/sally14/NLPBasics/blob/master/Report/report.pdf) brief synthesis about deep learning and NLP basics.
