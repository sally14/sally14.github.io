# Welcome to my page!



## Current work
I am Salomé Do, a PhD student working at LATTICE (Ecole Normale Supérieure) and médialab (Sciences Po). I'm working on natural language processing and its applications to social sciences. Before that, I was a student at ENSAE, interested in machine and deep learning. 

My work aims at developing innovative methods for modelling and mapping public issues based on their textual traces. Its ambition is twofold: on the one hand, to make it possible to compare the semantic spaces that result from different social spaces, and on the other hand, to finely model the argumentation and enunciation of actors in textual content from the web. The dissertation thus aims at describing the structure of the discursive dynamics of actors in different discussion arenas from the most public media space (press) to the conversational spaces hosted by social networks (Twitter, Facebook). 
<!-- 
Some of my first projects so far are documented here : 

 - [embeddings](https://sally14.github.io/embeddings/index.html) is a small project aiming at giving a simple wrapper to preprocess text and generate word2vec embeddings in an easy way. The preprocessing part is written by me and totally multiprocessed, so that large corpus can be treated efficiently. The word2vec model learning part is a simple cli wrapper based on [gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/). 
 
 
 Further projects on embeddings and contextual embeddings across social spaces are in progress.

## Teaching

 
 Apart from that, I :
 - worked as a teaching assistant for Xavier Dupré's [Python for data scientist course at ENSAE](http://www.xavierdupre.fr/app/ensae_teaching_cs/helpsphinx/td_2a.html). I wrote some introductory material for my students, that you can find on my [teaching page](./teaching/teachings.md)
 - Teached a course named  **"Learning text representation for Social Sciences"** at Université Gustave Eiffel. A short syllabus can be found [here](/data/teaching_stuff/syllabus.pdf)
 - Worked as a teaching assistant for the [ML for NLP](https://nlp-ensae.github.io/) course at ENSAE.

 

 
## Previous work


On previous projects, I created biomedical named entity recognition systems for a startup called Posos which led to [this](https://github.com/sally14/NLPBasics/blob/master/Report/report.pdf) synthesis about deep learning and NLP basics, and wrote a [langage model script with Tensorflow](https://github.com/sally14/language-model-ENSAE) for a NLP course at ENSAE.
